# üåü EzCode Beginner Tutorial: Learn to Code with Blocks

## üëã Welcome to EzCode!

EzCode is a visual programming language designed for absolute beginners. You‚Äôll build your first program by connecting **blocks**, not writing complicated syntax. Let‚Äôs walk through the basics step-by-step.

---

## üìå What You‚Äôll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you‚Äôll be able to:
- Understand the EzCode workspace
- Build a simple program using visual blocks
- Use variables, loops, and conditionals
- Create and run your own project

---

## üõ† Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace

1. Go to the **EzCode Playground** (a web-based editor like Scratch or Blockly).
2. You‚Äôll see a **block palette** on the left and a **workspace** in the center.
3. Drag blocks from the palette into your workspace.

## üöÄ Step 2: Your First Program ‚Äî ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù

1. Find the **Text** category.
2. Drag a `print "Hello, World!"` block into the workspace.
3. Click the **Run** button.
4. üéâ Output appears on the screen: `Hello, World!`

> ‚úÖ Tip: Blocks only snap together if they‚Äôre meant to fit ‚Äî no syntax errors!

---

## üîÅ Step 3: Add a Loop

Let‚Äôs make the computer say ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù five times.

1. Drag a `repeat 5 times` block from the **Loops** category.
2. Snap the `print "Hi!"` block inside the loop.
3. Click **Run**.

**Output:**
```
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
Hi!
```

## üì¶ Step 4: Use Variables

Let‚Äôs store a name and greet the user.

1. From **Variables**, create a new variable called `name`.
2. Drag a `set name to "Chastidy"` block.
3. Drag a `print "Hello, " + name` block.

**Output:**
```
Hello, Chastidy
```

## üß† Step 5: Add a Conditional

Let‚Äôs make a program that checks if someone is old enough to vote.

1. Drag a `set age to 19` block.
2. Use an `if` block from **Logic**.
3. Inside the `if`, add `if age ‚â• 18 then print "You can vote!"`
4. Add an `else` block with `print "You‚Äôre too young to vote."`

**Output:**
```
You can vote!
```

## üé® Step 6: Create Something Fun!

Try this challenge:

> Create a program that asks the user for their favorite dessert, stores it in a variable, and prints:  
> **"Yum! I love [dessert] too!"**

---

## üîö Final Thoughts

EzCode is all about making programming fun and accessible. Keep experimenting with:
- Loops
- Events
- User input
- Math operations

The more you practice, the more powerful your programs will become!
